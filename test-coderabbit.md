# CodeRabbit Workflow Test

This is a test file to verify the CodeRabbit integration workflow.

## Features to test

- [ ] Automatic commit and push
- [ ] PR creation
- [ ] CodeRabbit review waiting
- [ ] Bot comment summarization
- [ ] Vercel preview deployment

## Test Code

> Note: The following JavaScript snippet intentionally violates lint rules (var, spacing, semicolons) to exercise the review workflow. Do not use in production.

```javascript
// This code has some intentional issues for CodeRabbit to find
function testFunction(x) {
    var result = x * 2;
    if(result>10){
        console.log("Result is greater than 10");
    }
    return result
}

// Missing semicolon above
// No proper spacing in if condition
// var instead of const/let
```

This file will trigger the workflow when committed.

## Additional Test Content

> Note: The following TypeScript snippet intentionally uses `any`, loose equality, and missing semicolons for testing.

```typescript
// More test code with potential issues
let data: any = null;
if(data == undefined) {
    console.log('Data is not defined')  // Missing semicolon
}

// Using 'any' type
// Using loose equality (==) instead of strict (===)
// Missing semicolon
```
